Feature "Make naming great again"
x --> refactor podcast querying so that stream urls are available sooner
x --> refactor filename generation so that the concept of a "simple" file name is eliminated
--> extract context from podcast data structure and supply it to namer
--> extract ordinal from podcast list and supply it to namer
--> remove the concept of naming mode
--> apply title regex
--> apply context operators
